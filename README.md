# Teran-Machine-Learning

## EDA & Data Preparation
Our dataset include 3 type of stress (anxiety, depressed, panicking) in Indonesia and total dataset is 500 data.

## Data Processing
The data processing steps we follow include loading the dataset, performing label encoding on categorical variables, separating the dataset into features and labels, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Machine Learning Model
We use a Neural Network model with TensorFlow and Keras for training data and create layer model (dense layer and dropout layer). We achieved an accuracy of > 99% for students stress detection and saved the model with keras model h5.
